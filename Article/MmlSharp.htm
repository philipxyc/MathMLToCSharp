<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A while ago, I worked on a product where part of the effort involved turning math equations into code. 
  At the time, I wasn&#39;t the person who was allocated the role, so my guess is the 
  code was written by simply taking the equations from word and translating them by 
  hand into C#. All well and good, but it got me thinking: is there a way to 
  automate this process so that human error can be eliminated from this, 
  admittedly boring, task? Well, turns out it is possible and that&#39;s what this 
  article is about.</p>
<h2>Equations, eh?</h2>
<p>I&#39;d guess that barring any special math packages (such as Matlab), most of us 
  developers get math requirements in Word format. For example, you might get something as 
  simple as this:</p>
<img src="MmlSharp1.jpg" />
<p>This equation is easy to program. Here, let me do it: <code>y = a*x*x + b*x + c;</code> However,
sometimes you end up getting <em>really</em> nasty equations, kind of like the 
  following:</p>
<img src="MmlSharp2.jpg" />
<p>Got the above from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state">Wikipedia</a>. 
  Anyways, you should be getting the point by now: the above baby is a bit too 
  painful to program. I mean, I&#39;m sure if you have an infinite budget or access to 
  very cheap labour you could do it, but I guarantee you&#39;d get errors, since 
  getting it right every time (if you&#39;ve got a hundred) is difficult.</p>
<p>So my thinking was: hey, there ought to be a way of getting the equation data 
  structured somehow, and then you could restructure it for C#. That&#39;s where 
  MathML entered the picture.</p>
<h2>MathML</h2>
<p>Okay, so you are probably wondering what this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML">MathML</a> beast is. 
  Basically, it&#39;s an XML-like mark-up language for math. If all browsers supported it, you&#39;d 
  be seeing the equations above rendered using the browser&#39;s characters instead of 
  bitmaps. But regardless, there&#39;s one tool that supports it: Word. Microsoft Word 
  2007, to be precise. There&#39;s a little-known trick to get Word to turn equations 
  into MathML. You basically have to locate the equation options...</p>

<p>and choose the MathML option:</p>

<p>Okay, now copying our first equation onto the clipboard will result in something like the following:</p>
<table cellspacing="10" border="0">
<tr>
<td><img src="MmlSharp3.jpg" /></td>
<td>
<pre>
&lt;mml:math&gt;
  &lt;mml:mi&gt;y&lt;/mml:mi&gt;
  &lt;mml:mo&gt;=&lt;/mml:mo&gt;
  &lt;mml:mi&gt;a&lt;/mml:mi&gt;
  &lt;mml:msup&gt;
    &lt;mml:mrow&gt;
      &lt;mml:mi&gt;x&lt;/mml:mi&gt;
    &lt;/mml:mrow&gt;
    &lt;mml:mrow&gt;
      &lt;mml:mn&gt;2&lt;/mml:mn&gt;
    &lt;/mml:mrow&gt;
  &lt;/mml:msup&gt;
  &lt;mml:mo&gt;+&lt;/mml:mo&gt;
  &lt;mml:mi mathvariant=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;bx&lt;/mml:mi&gt;
  &lt;mml:mo&gt;+&lt;/mml:mo&gt;
  &lt;mml:mi&gt;c&lt;/mml:mi&gt;
&lt;/mml:math&gt;
</pre>

  <p>You can probably guess what this all means by looking at the original equation. Hey, we just ripped out the structure 
  of an equation! That&#39;s pretty cool, except for one problem: converting it to C#! 
  (Otherwise it&#39;s meaningless)</p>
<h2>Syntax Tree</h2>
<p>Keeping data the way we get it is no good. There&#39;s lots of extra information 
  (like that italic statement near bx) and there&#39;s info missing (like the 
  multiplication sign that ought to be between b and x). So our take on the 
  problem is turn this XML structure into a more OOP, XML-like structure. In fact, 
  that&#39;s what the program does &ndash; it turns XML elements into corresponsing C# classes. In most cases, XML and C#
  hava a 1-to-1 correspondance, so that an <code>&lt;mi/&gt;</code> element turns into an <code>Mi</code> class. 
  So woo-hoo, without too much effort, we turn XML into a syntax tree. Now, the 
  tree is imperfect, but it&#39;s there. Let us instead discuss some of the thorny 
  issues that we had to overcome.</p>

<p><b>Single/multi-letter variables</b>. Does &#39;sin&#39; mean s times i times n or a 
  variable called &#39;sin&#39; or the <code>Math.Sin</code> function? When I 
  looked at the equations I had, some of them used multiple letters, some were 
  single-letter. There&#39;s no &#39;one size fits all&#39; solution as to how to treat those. 
  Basically, I made this an option.</p>
  <p><b>The times (&times;) sign</b>. If you write ab it might mean a times b. If that's the case
  you need to find all locations where the multiplication has been omitted. On a funny note, there
  are also different Unicode symbols used by the times sign in different math editing packages
  (I was testing with MathML as well as Word). The end result is that finding where the
  multiplication sign is missing is very difficult.</p>
<p><b>Greek to Roman.</b> Some people object to having Greek constants in C# code. 
  Hey, I code in UTF-8, so I can include anything, including Japanese characters 
  and those other funny Unicode symbols. It does mess up 
  IntelliSense because your keyboard probably doesn&#39;t have Greek keys - unless you 
  live in Greece, that is. Plus, it&#39;s a way to very quickly kill maintainability. So one feature I had to add is turning Greek letters 
  into Roman descriptions, so that &Delta; would become <code>Delta</code> and so on. 
  Actually, Delta is a special case because we are so used to attaching it to our 
  variables (e.g., writing &Delta;V). Consequently, I added a special rule for &Delta; to be kept attached even in cases
  where all other variables are single-letter.</p>
<p><b>Correctly treating <code>e</code>, <code>&pi;</code> and <code>exp</code>.</b> 
  Basically, the letter pi (&pi;) can be just a variable, or it can mean <code>Math.PI</code>.
  Same goes for the letter e &ndash; it could be <code>Math.E</code> and in most cases it is.
  Another, more painful substitution is exp to <code>Math.Exp</code>. Support for all three of these
  had to be added.</p>
<p><b>Power inlining</b>. Most people know that <code>x*x</code> is faster than <code>Math.Pow(x, 2.0)</code>,
especially when dealing with integers. Inlining powers of X and above is an option in the program. I have
seen articles (can't find the link) where people claim that you lose precision if you avoid doing it the
<code>Math.Pow</code> way. I'm not sure though.</p>
<p>There were plenty of other problems in converting from XML to C#, but the main 
  idea stayed the same: correctly implement the Visitor pattern over each possible 
  MathML element, removing unnecessary information and supplying that information 
  which is missing. Let&#39;s look at some examples.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Okay, I bet you can't wait to see an actual example. Let's start with what we had before:</p>
<img src="MmlSharp1.jpg" />
<p>Here is the (somewhat simple) output:</p>
<pre>
y=a*x*x+b*x+c;
</pre>
<p>
  I omitted the initialization steps for variables that the program also creates.</p>
<p>
  Let&#39;s look at the more complex equation. Here it is, in case you have forgotten:</p>
<img src="MmlSharp2.jpg" />
  <p>
    Care to guess what the output of our tool is?</p>
<pre>
p = rho*R*T + (B_0*R*T-A_0-((C_0) / (T*T))+((E_0) / (Math.Pow(T, 4))))*rho*rho +
    (b*R*T-a-((d) / (T)))*Math.Pow(rho, 3) +
    alpha*(a+((d) / (t)))*Math.Pow(rho, 6) +
    ((c*Math.Pow(rho, 3)) / (T*T))*(1+gamma*rho*rho)*Math.Exp(-gamma*rho*rho);
</pre>
<p>Okay, let&#39;s do another example just to be sure &ndash; this time with a square root. Here is the equation:</p>
  <p><img src="MmlSharp5.jpg" /></p>
  <p>I've turn power inlining off for this one - we don't want the expression with the root being evaluated twice. Here is the outout:</p>
  <pre>
a = 0.42748 * ((Math.Pow((R*T_c), 2)) / (P_c)) * 
  Math.Pow((1 + m * (1 - Math.Sqrt(T_r))), 2);</pre>
  <p>Is this great or what? If you are ever handed a 100-page document full of 
  formulae, well, you can surprise your client by coding them really quickly.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
I hope you like the tool. Maybe you'll even find it useful.
